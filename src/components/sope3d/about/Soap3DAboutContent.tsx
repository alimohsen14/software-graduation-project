        Nablus soap is a Castile soap produced only in Nablus in the West Bank,
        Palestine. Its chief ingredients are virgin olive oil, water, and an
        alkaline sodium compound. The finished product is ivory-colored and has
        almost no scent.

      <p className="mt-4 text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
        Before the First World War, there were more than 30 soap factories in
        Nablus. Today, only a handful remain, preserving a tradition that dates
        back to the 10th century.
