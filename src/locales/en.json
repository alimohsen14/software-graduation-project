Fuel was burned inside the Qammim, and heat was transferred through the base of the pot to the mixture of oil and other materials. A passage was also dedicated for smoke to exit outside the building to reduce its accumulation inside the workplace. The Qammim is characterized by its small area and low ceiling, as it was designed for only one function, which is lighting the fire. (The Qammim is located directly below this staircase, but it is not visible in this module)"

This pot was made of thick copper to withstand high temperatures, and it was heated from below by fire coming from the Qammim. It was designed to accommodate large quantities of olive oil, enough to produce a full batch of soap."

As for the Dakshab, it is a longer and wider wooden tool, like a large spoon, and it is used during later cooking stages to stir the mixture continuously, ensuring its homogeneity and preventing it from sticking or burning."

The Mabzal is used to drain what is known as 'fermentation water', which is the liquid that separates from the oil mixture during the initial cooking stages. At the beginning of heating, part of the liquid separates from the oil due to different density, collects at the bottom of the pot, and is then pulled through the Mabzal opening to special adjacent basins. The presence of the Mabzal below the pot indicates the precision of the soap factory design."

On this floor, several consecutive stages were carried out, starting with spreading the soap on the ground, then leveling its surface. After it solidifies, it is divided into equal squares, stamped with the factory's seal, and then cut into separate pieces. After that, the pieces are arranged in conical piles known as 'Tananeer'."
