A passage was also dedicated for smoke to exit outside the building to reduce its accumulation inside the workplace.

The Mabzal is used to drain what is known as 'fermentation water', which is the liquid that separates from the oil mixture during the initial cooking stages. At the beginning of heating, part of the liquid separates from the oil due to different density, collects at the bottom of the pot, and is then pulled through the Mabzal opening to special adjacent basins. The presence of the Mabzal below the pot indicates the precision of the soap factory design."
