        "title": "Soap Factories and Nabulsi Soap: the story of an industry from the heart of the Old City",
        "intro1": "Soap manufacturing in the city of Nablus was carried out inside buildings dedicated to this purpose from the beginning, and they were engineered to serve the production process directly. These buildings are known as Masabin or Sabanat. These buildings were planned to suit the stages of soap manufacturing, so that each level of the building has a specific function within the production process. The design of the soap factory was not random, but rather completely consistent with the nature of the industry and its requirements.",
        "intro2": "Soap factory buildings spread throughout all neighborhoods of the Old City of Nablus without exception, with a greater density in the southern side of the city, especially around what is known as Soap Factory Street. These massive buildings merged elegantly within the urban fabric of the Old City, and became one of the architectural elements that distinguish the Old City and give it a special and unique character. The architectural design of the soap factories has maintained the traditional function for which these buildings were established, just as Nabulsi soap has maintained its components and traditional manufacturing method until today.",
        "intro3": "Because the soap industry depends on natural materials that do not leave unpleasant odors or unwanted residues during the manufacturing process, there was nothing to prevent the establishment of soap factories within residential neighborhoods. In fact, many soap factories were adjacent to their owners' homes, and the owner's house was sometimes built above or directly next to it, reflecting the extent of the link between residential life and industrial activity within the Old City.",
        "characteristic": "The soap factory building is distinguished by its massiveness and the presence of a large entrance designed to facilitate the input of raw materials used in the soap industry, such as olive oil, qalu, lime, and jift, as well as facilitating the exit of ready-made soap intended for sale. The building usually consists of two main floors (see figure): the ground floor and the upper floor. The ground floor is wide and relatively dark, and has a high ceiling composed of cross vaults carried on very massive stone pillars, the cross-sectional area of one pillar being between one and a half to two square meters. These pillars divide the open interior space into approximately equal sections, and there are no internal walls in this floor except those that define the office of the soap factory owner.",
        "fig1": "Figure (1): A diagram showing the different levels within the soap factory and the functions performed at each level",
        "floor1": "The first floor or 'Al-Mafrash' (see Figure 2) was designed in a way that suits the function for which it is used, which is spreading, cutting, and drying the cooked soap. The first floor is wide and open, a space where there are only the massive pillars that carry the cross vaults. Although the height of the first floor is less than the ground floor, its windows are large, occupying most of the solid facade overlooking the street, and were designed to allow air input and accelerate soap drying. As for the stairs that connect the floors to each other, they were high, narrow, and dark, and workers had to climb the slippery steps many times carrying buckets filled with cooked soap to be emptied onto the spreading floor.",
        "fig2": "Figure (2)",
        "groundFloor": "The function of the ground floor (see Figure 3) is the most important in the soap factory building, as the soap cooking process, which occupies most of this floor, takes place in it. There are also side spaces dedicated to storing fuel and raw materials used in the industry, in addition to the presence of massive wells dug under the floor of the soap factory to store olive oil, which is the main material in the soap industry. These wells had openings in the floor of the soap factory from which the oil was drawn using special buckets when needed for use in the cooking process.",
        "fig3": "Figure (3)",
        "underground": "As for the level located under the floor of the soap factory, it contains a number of large wells built of stone and lined from the inside, dedicated to storing olive oil. The number of these wells in one soap factory ranges between three to seven wells, and each well has a storage capacity that differs from the other, ranging from five tons to thirty tons of oil, and sometimes reaching more than that. This large size of storage shows the extent of production within the soap factories and their dependence on huge quantities of oil as a basic material for the industry.",
        "cookingProcess": "The process of preparing and cooking soap takes place in a dedicated place inside the ground floor that is slightly higher than the floor level, and contains a large copper pot known as 'Al-Halla'. The diameter of this pot is about two meters, its depth reaches two meters or more, while its base thickness is nearly two and a half centimeters. The pot is built inside a thick wall of firestone to maintain heat, and can hold approximately two hundred and fifty jars of olive oil, i. e., more than five tons of oil, in addition to other materials that enter the soap industry. This large size of pots shows the enormity of production within a single soap factory.",
        "office": "An office was also allocated inside the soap factory building for its owner, containing several windows, some of which overlook the inside of the soap factory so that the owner can monitor the work progress and supervise the production stages, while some overlook the outer street. The presence of this office inside the building reflects the direct administrative role of the soap factory owner in managing the production process and following up on work affairs."

        "title": "Nabulsi Soap Factories",
        "intro": "For hundreds of years, Nablus was surrounded by green mountains full of olive trees. Travelers and historians such as Ibn Battuta and Mujir al-Din al-Hanbali described the city as one of the Levant's cities richest in oil and olives. Nablus oil was carried to Egypt, Damascus, and even the Hejaz. From this pure oil was born one of the purest types of soap in the region: Nabulsi soap.",
        "section1": "The story begins in the heart of the soap factory, on the ground floor dedicated to cooking soap, where a massive copper pot rises in its center, with a thick base, wide diameter, and deep cavity, built around it with firestones to keep the heat. This pot was not small or ordinary, but could accommodate huge quantities of olive oil, (see Figure 1) exceeding five tons in one batch, along with other materials used in soap manufacture. Directly under this place is the 'Al-Qamim' room, where fire is constantly light to heat the pot from below, and the smoke rises through special passages designed inside the building.",
        "fig1": "Figure (1): Soap cooking pot inside the soap factory",
        "section2": "With the fire lit, the cooking stage begins, as olive oil is added to the pot, then 'Al-Khumri' water is added to it, which is water containing soda after being dissolved and treated. This addition was not made all at once, but was repeated several times according to a precise system, as the 'Al-Khumri' water is drawn from the bottom of the pot into special basins, then re-concentrated and re-poured over the oil again, in a process known as 'Al-Radda'. During this repeated cycle, the mixture inside the pot is stirred with a long wooden tool used specifically for this task, until the oil begins its gradual transformation into soap.",
        "section3": "With the cooking continuing, workers were monitoring precisely the interaction of materials inside the pot, as an increase or decrease in soda could spoil the entire batch. Therefore, the responsibility for monitoring maturity fell on the head of workers, who uses a cylindrical wooden tool that is dipped in soap then its smell and texture are checked between the hands, to ensure that the saponification process is complete, and that the oil has completely turned into soap suitable for spreading and shaping.",
        "section4": "When the soap cooking is complete inside the pot, the stage of moving it to the upper floor, known as 'Al-Mafrash', begins. This floor was wide, with large windows that allow light and air to enter, (see Figure 2) and was designed specifically for this stage of work. The hot soap is poured onto the floor of the 'Al-Mafrash', then spread carefully to take an equal thickness in all its parts, and its surface is leveled using specialized tools, until it turns into a large, level layer covering the floor of the place.",
        "fig2": "Figure (2)",
        "section5": "After the soap cools slightly, the stage of planning and cutting begins. Straight lines are drawn on the surface of the soap to divide it into equal squares, then each piece is stamped with the soap factory's seal that carries its mark, using a wooden hammer and a metal seal. After that, the pieces are cut into small cubes of equal size known as 'Al-Falaq', and they are rearranged on the floor in preparation for the drying stage.",
        "section6": "Work does not end here, as soap needs a long time to dry and harden and become suitable for use. (see Figure 3) Therefore, pieces are stacked on top of each other in the form of hollow conical towers known as 'Tananir', and space is left between them to allow air passage, so the pieces dry gradually over weeks, which may extend to a month or more, depending on humidity and heat.",
        "fig3": "Figure (3)",
        "section7": "When the drying process is complete, the 'Tananir' are dismantled, and each mold of soap is wrapped in paper bearing the name of the producing soap factory, then the pieces are collected in bags or boxes in preparation for their transport and sale. Thus ends a long journey that began with olive oil in the soap factory's wells, and ended with ready-made soap pieces moving from the heart of Nablus to homes and markets.",
